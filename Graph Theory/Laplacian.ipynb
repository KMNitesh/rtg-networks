    "<h1>Laplacian Theory</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "For any graph $G = (V,E)$, one can define a matrix to represent the similarity of vertices in $V$. The most simple of these matrices is the <b>adjacency matrix</b> $W$, defined by \n",
    "$$W_{i,j} = 1 \\quad \\text{if   } (i,j) \\in E$$\n",
    "and $W_{ij} = 0$ otherwise. The adjacency matrix $W$ is simple because the $ij$th off-diagonal entry of $W$ is 1 if and only if there exists an edge between vertices $i$ and $j$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another commonly used similarity matrix is some form of <b>distance matrix</b> $W^D$ of the form:\n",
    "$$W^D_{i,j} = g(i,j) \\quad \\text{if   } ||F(i) - F(j)||_2 < r$$\n",
    "and $W^D_{i,j} = 0$ otherwise, where $g$ and $F$ are functions, $g$ is strictly positive, and $r > 0$ is a user-defined parameter. Commonly, $g(i,j)$ is taken to be the kernel function so that\n",
    "$$W^D_{i,j} = exp(-\\frac{||F(i) - F(j)||_2}{\\sigma^2}) \\quad \\text{if   } ||F(i) - F(j)||_2 < r$$\n",
    "where $\\sigma^2$ is another user-defined parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "For any similarity matrix, the <b>degree matrix</b> is defined as $D_{i,i} = \\sum_{j}W_{i,j}$ on the diagonal and 0 off-diagonal. The $i$-th diagonal entry of the degree matrix represents the total number of connections that the node $i$ has to all other nodes in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any graph $G$, one can define a matrix, the <b>combinatorial Laplacian</b>, which can be written as \n",
    "$$L^{comb} = D - W$$\n",
    "where $D$ is the $n \\times n$ diagonal degree matrix and $W$ is the adjacency matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an undirected graph with a combinatorial Laplacian L, then\n",
    "\n",
    "* L is symmetric.\n",
    "* L is positive-semidefinite.\n",
    "* The smallest eigenvalue of L is 0.\n",
    "* The dimension of the null space of L is the number of connected components in G.\n",
    "* has all of its rows and all of its columns sum to 0\n",
    "\n",
    "For any graph $G$ one is also able to define the <b>normalized Laplacian</b>, which can be written as\n",
    "$$L^{norm} = D^{-\\frac{1}{2}}L^{comb}D^{-\\frac{1}{2}} = I - D^{-\\frac{1}{2}}WD^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$$\n",
    "where $I$ is the identity matrix, $W$ is the adjacency matrix, and $D$ is the degree matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "The combinatorial and normalized Laplacian matrices are useful objects because it can be shown that their eigenvectors with small eigenvalues (near 0) can help to form a good partition of a graph. But what is considered an effective partition a graph?\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Partitioning criterion</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, a partition $\\{V_1, \\ldots, V_K\\}$ of a graph $G = (V,E)$ is effective if it minimizes either the <b>Normalized Cut criterion</b>\n",
    "$$\\sum_{i=1}^KNCut(V_i, V_i^C) = \\sum_{i=1}^K\\frac{cut(V_i,V_i^C)}{assoc(V_i,V)},$$\n",
    "which is biased to balancing the number of *edges* in each set $V_i$ of the partition, or the <b>Ratio Cut criterion</b>\n",
    "$$\\sum_{i=1}^KRCut(V_i, V_i^C) = \\sum_{i=1}^K\\frac{cut(V_i,V_i^C)}{|V_i|},$$\n",
    "which is biased to balancing the number of *nodes* in each set $V_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimizing either of these quantities exactly is an NP-hard problem. However, it can be shown (in a way similar to the Shi and Malik) that the 2nd to $K+1$ smallest eigenvectors of the normalized Laplacian ($L^{norm}$) can be used to approximate the optimal solution to the minimum normalized cut problem and the 2nd to $K+1$ smallest eigenvectors of the combinatorial Laplacian ($L^{comb}$) can be used to approximate the optimal solution to the minimum ratio cut problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, clustering using the normalized Laplacian ($L^{norm}$) tends to balance the number of edges in each of the sets $V_i$ in the partition $\\{V_1, \\ldots, V_K\\}$, while clustering using the combinatorial Laplacian ($L^{comb}$) tends to balance the number of nodes."
