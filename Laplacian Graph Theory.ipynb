    "For an unweighted, undirected graph $G$ that has only 1 connected component, the null space of its Lapacian $L$ is the span of the vector $\\mathbf{1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5>Proof</h5>\n",
    "Suppose a graph $G$ has only 1 connected component.  It is immediately evident for $q \\in \\mathbf{R}$ that $span(\\mathbf{1}) = (q\\mathbf{1}) \\subseteq null(L)$, since $$(L (q\\mathbf{1}))_i = \\sum_{j=1}^n W_{i,j} ((q\\mathbf{1})_i - (q\\mathbf{1})_j) = \\sum_{j=1}^n W_{i,j} (q - q) = 0, \\quad i = 1,\\ldots,n.$$\n",
    "Now suppose that there exists a vector $x \\in null(L)$ such that $x$ can not be expressed in the form $q\\mathbf{1}$ where $q \\in \\mathbf{R}$.  Then, $x_i \\ne x_j$ for at least one $i \\ne j$ and $$(L x)_i = \\sum_{j=1}^n W_{i,j} (x_i - x_j) = 0, \\quad i = 1,\\ldots,n.$$  This implies that the quadratic form $$x^TLx = \\sum_{i,j : i > j}W_{i,j}(x_i - x_j)^2 = \\sum_{i,j \\in E}(x_i - x_j)^2 = 0,$$ which can only occur when $x_i = x_j, \\forall i,j$. This contradicts the supposition that $x_i \\ne x_j$ for at least one $i \\ne j$. Therefore, if $x \\in null(L)$ then $x_i = x_j, \\forall i,j \\Longleftrightarrow x \\in span(\\mathbf{1})$.  Thus, $null(L) \\subseteq span(\\mathbf{1})$.\n",

    "A graph $\\mathbf{G} = (\\mathbf{V},\\mathbf{E})$ can be partitioned into two disjoint sets $A$ and $B$ (where $A \\cup B = V$ and $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$) by removing edges connecting the two parts. In graph theory, the *cut* of $A$ and $B$ $$cut(A,B) = \\sum_{u \\in A, v \\in B}w(u,v)$$ is a measure of dissimilarity between the two pieces of the graph. In the case of an undirected unweighted graph, the cut is simply the number of edges in $E$ that are removed in forming the partition. \n",

    "A simple partitioning criterion, the *minimized cut*, claims that the optimal bipartitioning of a graph minimizes the value of $cut(A,B)$.  However, this criterion can be shown to be biased to favor cutting small nodes in isolated portions of the graph. To avoid this unnatural bias, Shi and Malik proposed the **normalized cut**\n",

    "where $assoc(A,V) = \\sum_{u \\in A, t \\in V}w(u,t)$ is the total connection from nodes in A to all nodes in the graph. The intuition behind this measure is to examine the cut cost as a fraction of the total edge connections to all nodes in the graph. Shi and Malik argued that minimizing the normalized cut is a good criterion for forming a reasonable partition of $G$ because it simultaneously minimized dissociation between the groups and maximized association within the groups. Through a rigorous derivation, Shi and Malik showed that \n",
